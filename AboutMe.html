    <p> I am freshly graduated from a Visusal Communication Design program at Eastern Washington University. It is my second bachelor of arts degree. I earned my first degree B.A. in Sociology from EWU in 2010. I had goals of attending graduate school in a related program, but I struggled finding one that offered a real career upon graduation. In 2013, I attended two days of graduate school at Gonzaga University and quickly realized I was in a program that I had no real passion for. I was upset with myself for quitting and stepping away from advanced positions at my current job. I knew I needed to be back in school pursuing a degree I was passionate about and specifically one that I could make into a fullfilling career, but I had no idea what it would be.</p>
        <p>After graduating from my first degree, I began exploring fine arts in my spare time. Drawing was never something I could do growing up. I failed all the time. I could barely draw convincing stick figures, let alone a face or a form. Often, I bribed my sister to render illustrations for me. One afternoon, I tentatively picked up a pencil and a piece of paper and reintroduced myself to this forboding relationship. I started slowly. I began with tracing images and quickly moved onto to drawing them freely --connecting the eye and the hand together. I began to have some success and realized I was enjoying the time spent navigating what were often treacherous waters.</p>
        <p>The year or so priors I began skiing with my college buddy and I loved every minute of it. He ignited a new passion within me for skiing and my enthusiasm for The Great Outdoors. After removing myself from graduate school at Gonzaga, I remembered a friend of a friend graduated from a graphic design program at EWU. I talked to him about the program and soon realized I needed to enroll in the program. I had found my calling. I could pair my love for The Great Outdoors and skiing with The Visual Communication Design program at EWU and make it a career. </p>
    <p> That is where I stand now --fighting for a foot in the door.</p>
