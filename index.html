    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>
    <p>Hopefully...</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.cryptarismission.com/#!/main-menu"> Cryptar is Mission.</a><p>I like the centered menu. I like the minimal, thin, bleak type used. It reminds me of video I watched about Norse mythology. The title of the video felt cold and bleak. It used a slim, sans serif typeface. I like the simplicity of this menu. The user experience is straight forward and accessible.</p></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.evo.com/"> Evo.</a><p> This is one of my favorite retail websites to purchase my outdoor clothing and gear. I like the 5 circles that correspond to the rotating pictures that slide across the screen. In this class, I would like to make a portfolio website for my work. These sliding pictures could be a preview of my work that directs viewers to my work. I also enjoy the clean and orderly rectangles that contain pictures and text below. Instead of a centered column menu, these rectangles could be used to help navigate the user experience.</p></li>
    <li><a href="http://uncharted.sunbrella.com/">Uncharted Waters.</a><p> This opening page is okay. I can see where I could get inspiration from it to create my portfolio website. I wouldn't mind having a snowy nature scene play in the background like the way this page does. Using circles and other geometric shapes will be useful to help navigate the user around my page. I could use three circles, or more, the direct users to my portfolio, resume, contact information, and a short biography.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://yearinmusic.spotify.com/en-US/worlds-top-genres/global"> Spotify.</a><p> The scrolling user experience is interesting, but atleast the way this website uses it I don't think it would be to my benefit for a portfolio website. If you scroll to Top Genres page, I like the layout. I like the sans serif font in the box; I could replace that with my name. The five bands of color could be used in the same way as the circles I talked about in line 14. The use of color is really pretty and could be used to my advantage if I wanted to convey a sense of mood while viewers looked at my portfolio page.</p></li>
    <li><a href="http://follow-your-intuition.com/"> Follow your Intuition.</a><p> First off, I really like the sans serif type face for Follow your Intuition, the bleakness of the page, and the circle containing start. It very minimal.The rest of the website and user experience is slow to load and I wouldn't use this for my portfolio website, but it is fun. A bit gimicky?</p></li>
